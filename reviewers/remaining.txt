Remaining issues:

* shorten


Reviewer #2 would also like to include:

  * motivation of the intuitions

  * examples

  * more compare and contrast with Owczarzak et al.

  * more motivation on mean-removal (why is sec 5 different from 4)

  * more motivation on sentence weighting

  * dropping section 6


Minor suggestions:

  * R1: explain more of why sec 4 correlations are low vs. MetricsMATR
        correlations? 

  * R2: drop the "table-of-contents"

  * R2: discussion of benefit of overweighting

  * R2: drastically reduce discussion of \mu type
