Comments for the Author:

Reviewer #1: This submission on Dependency Pair Match MT metrics is technically and structurally sound, thorough, and well-written.  Some specific comments/questions below, in order of appearance in the paper.

As per the submission guidelines, submissions must be limited to 12 pages of content, with an additional page for references.  The current version has 16.5 pages plus one page of references, so significant shortening will be necessary.  I find the overall balance of sections adequate, so I would recommend shortening across the board rather than in one particular section.

The correlations reported in section 4 (tables I-III) are overall quite low (also compared to EDPM's r correlations for Chinese source data in NIST's MetricsMATR challenge).  Could you comment on this?
