actual working file is mtjournal.tex

build is a script that sets environments so that the kluwer subdir
(which has the Kluwer templates) can be read by latex and bibtex. use
cases:

build latex mtjournal
build bibtex mtjournal
build latex mtjournal

etc...

edpm-paper.tex is still live because I've been copying stuff from it
and moving it over to the new paper, but don't use it.
