actual working file is mtjournal.tex

build is a script that sets environments so that the kluwer subdir
(which has the Kluwer templates) can be read by latex and bibtex. use
cases:

  ./build latex mtjournal
  ./build bibtex mtjournal
  ./build latex mtjournal
  ./build latex mtjournal

etc...

To construct the actual tarball to send to the publisher, use the ship
script:

  ./ship

will construct a tarball named mtjournal-2009-05-12.tgz (assuming it's
May 11, 2009!) with the following contents:

  # the Kluwer classes
   mtjournal-2009-05-11/klu*.{cls,clo,sty}

  # source for this paper:
   mtjournal-2009-05-11/mtjournal.{tex,bbl}

  # .eps figures
   mtjournal-2009-05-11/dpm-*.eps

  # a pre-built PDF and PS for double-checking
   mtjournal-2009-05-11/mtjournal.{pdf,ps}
