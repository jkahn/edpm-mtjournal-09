@inproceedings{charniak03syntaxlmmt,
  abstract =	 {We present a syntax-based language model for use in
                  noisy-channel machine translation. In particular, a
                  language model based upon that described in (Cha01)
                  is combined with the syntax based translation-model
                  described in (YK01). The resulting system was used
                  to translate 347 sentences from Chinese to English
                  and compared with the results of an
                  IBM-model-4-based system, as well as that of (YK02),
                  all trained on the same data. The translations were
                  sorted into four groups: good/bad syntax crossed
                  with good/bad meaning. While the total number of
                  translations that preserved meaning were the same
                  for (YK02) and the syntax-based system (and both
                  higher than the IBM-model-4-based system), the
                  syntax based system had 45\% more translations that
                  also had good syntax than did (YK02) (and
                  approximately 70\% more than IBM Model 4). The
                  number of translations that did not preserve
                  meaning, but at least had good grammar, also
                  increased, though to less avail.},

                  overly reliant on the Bleu machine translation
                  evaluation metric. We show that an improved Bleu
                  score is neither necessary nor sufficient for
                  achieving an actual improvement in translation
                  quality, and give two significant counterexamples to
                  Bleuâ€™s correlation with human judgments of
                  quality. This offers new potential for research
                  which was previously deemed unpromising by an
                  inability to improve upon Bleu scores.},

@inproceedings{och03mert,
  abstract =	 {Often, the training procedure for statistical
                  machine translation models is based on maximum
                  likelihood or related criteria. A general problem of
                  this approach is that there is only a loose relation
                  to the final translation quality on unseen text. In
                  this paper, we analyze various training criteria
                  which directly optimize translation quality.  These
                  training criteria make use of recently proposed
                  automatic evaluation metrics.  We describe a new
                  algorithm for efficient training an unsmoothed error
                  count.  We show that significantly better results
                  can often be obtained if the final evaluation
                  criterion is taken directly into account as part of
                  the training procedure.},
