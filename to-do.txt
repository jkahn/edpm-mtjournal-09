answer Mari's question about N-grams vs parse features

Issues around tuning

finalize conclusion

MARI's comments:


- I still don't like the title.  Maybe rather than "Predicting HTER
  improvements" you could say "Predicting translation quality".  One
  problem is that you are no longer looking at correlation with delta
  HTER (using mean-normalized is not the same as predicting
  "improvements").  The other is that you work is relevant to other
  human assessments than simply HTER.  Since a large fraction of MT
  researchers are not interested in HTER, I think you should not be so
  explicitly tied to that

- p. 2 line 2, extra )

- p. 7 middle: "Confidence of n-best list" --> "Confidence of n-best
  hypotheses" (since the confidence scores correspond to individual
  sentences, not the list as a whole

- p. 7: omit extra : after "Score combination"

- p. 8 bottom: "unweighted correlations effectively puts" -->
  "unweighted correlations effectively put"

- p. 14 sec 6.1, "E" description: "featureset" --> "feature set"

- p. 14: shouldn't T be the features from basic TER rather than basic
  TERp?  Which of these features are not in TER?


==========

look at detect-human experiment (rebuild?)
